📁 Image Corrosion – README.md

# 🖼 Image Corrosion Simulator (HTML | CSS | JavaScript)

This project simulates a basic image corrosion effect using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Built as Task 3 during my internship at Apex Planet Private Limited, it demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to manipulate image pixels in real time.

🔧 Features

* Upload and preview image
* Apply image corrosion using JavaScript
* Corrosion effect based on pixel data manipulation
* Responsive layout using HTML/CSS
* Real-time visual feedback on the canvas

📸 Demo

🧪 How It Works

* The image is drawn to a canvas element.
* Using getImageData(), the pixel data is accessed.
* A basic corrosion algorithm reduces brightness based on neighboring pixel data.
* The updated pixels are rendered back to the canvas.

🛠 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser
3. Upload an image and click “Corrode Image” to apply the effect

💡 Future Improvements

* Add erosion/dilation toggle
* Download processed image
* Corrosion strength slider
